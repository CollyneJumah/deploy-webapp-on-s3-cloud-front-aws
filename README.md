# Deploy Static Website on AWS

In this project, you will deploy a static website to AWS using S3, CloudFront, and IAM.

## The files included are: 

- index.html - The Index document for the website.
- /img - The background image file for the website.
- /vendor - Bootssrap CSS framework, Font, and JavaScript libraries needed for the website to function.
- /css - CSS files for the website.

## Project Overview
The cloud is perfect for hosting static websites that only include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that require no server-side processing. The whole project has two major intentions to implement:

- Hosting a static website on S3 and
- Accessing the cached website pages using CloudFront content delivery network (CDN) service. Recall that CloudFront offers low latency and high transfer speeds during website rendering.

`Note that Static website hosting essentially requires a public bucket, whereas the CloudFront can work with public and private buckets.`

### Steps to follow
In this project, you will deploy a static website to AWS by performing the following steps:

- You will create a public S3 bucket and upload the website files to your bucket.
- You will configure the bucket for website hosting and secure it using IAM policies.
- You will speed up content delivery using AWSâ€™s content distribution network service, CloudFront.
- You will access your website in a browser using the unique CloudFront endpoint
